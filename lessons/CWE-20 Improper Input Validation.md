One of the earliest things that coders are taught is that you should write code that passes your functions all of the data needed to run and in a form that the program can handle. Imagine you are writing a program that takes someone’s first initial and age. When using a strongly typed language, if you pass it an `int` for someone’s initial in place of a `char` the code would fail to compile entirely. On the other hand loosely typed languages are much more forgiving and might compile and run, taking in that Char and setting the person age to ‘Z’. If this happens it could cause an error down the line when you later attempt to multiply their age by 2 which leads to an error due to not being able to multiple Z*2. That is why in loosely typed languages it is so important to confirm that the data you are taking in is valid.

In a way taking user inputted data is like writing in a ‘loosest’ typed language. You are writing a function and then allowing the user to fill in the functions input however they would like. This is why it is extremely important to write code that validates that the users input matches the data format that your code is able to handle. Not checking your inputs is an extremely common way to introduce weakness into your code. The practice of poor input validation is known as Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)

There are many different ways that coders can introduce input validation into their code. The first of these is allowing the user to input whatever they would like, send it to the server, and have the server verify that the input is valid. This may be done in the case of email verification where an email is submitted, the server tests to see if it responds, and if not, it asks again for a valid address. A second option is adding limitations to the input box to prevent improper data types from being inputted. A common example of this is only allowing numbers to be typed in a phone number field. A third option is to give the user a choice of selections as opposed to a text box, this is often seen when a site is asking for ages and it provides a drop-down menu of the year you were born as opposed to having you type it in. Another technique to mitigate these kinds of attacks is using Static Analysis tools in order to look at data coming in. A final form of mitigation is using a practice called Fuzzing. Fuzzing is when programs are designed to throw an error when they receive improper inputs, this prevents the code from crashing due to something like someone putting a comma in their email as opposed to a period

While checking for improper input validations it is easy to focus on places where the user is directly able to type information into a box and send it to the server but there are other ways for users to send data that programmers should be aware of. One of the most commonly missed of these is the ability to edit cookies through third party programs allowing the programmer to inject data that the programmer did not validate. This could also allow the user to get around client-side input validation by editing a “validatedStudentEmail” tag to and setting it to true allowing them to send the string “Robert’);DROPTABLE Students;--” as there email causing issues down the line. Fixing issues that stem from these kinds of exploits take much more effort and often require planning to prevent them from the initial design of the project. 

Overall Improper Input Validation is something that all coders should be aware of and keeping an eye out for whenever they are taking data into a program.
