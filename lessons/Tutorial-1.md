Hello! and welcome to your first lesson. This unit is our tutorial and will get you familiar with the various aspects of our lesson page. Below is an example taken from the first
lesson in our unit on memory based CWE's. Feel free to check out the what we discuss on the page you're currently viewing.

At the top, highlighted in red, is the lesson material. You should read this before you move on to the challenge as it can provide you with critical and useful information. At the bottom you can see the scroll to challenge button, which will scroll down past the lesson to the challenge. Highlighted in green is the challenge area. This is an IDE in which you can complete the code challenge associated with the CWE covered in the lesson. All lessons have challenges, except this one. Every unit except this one will also have a final challenge. For this the lesson text will be replaced with a challenge overview, and the challenge can cover multiple CWE's discussed in that unit's lesson material. Highlighted in blue are some more buttons. The first is the submit code button. You can use this once you believe you have completed your challenge to check your given solution. Below that is the back to unit button. This button will take you back to the unit overview page. Below that is the scroll to lesson button. This functions similarly to the scroll to challenge button, when clicked it will scroll up to the top of the lesson. Below that there is the reset challenge button. If you get to a point during a challenge where you feel it might be better to just start over, you can click this button and revert the challenge to its original state. Finally at the bottom of the page there is the feedback box and the proceed button also highlighted in blue. The feedback box will display the output of the submit code button. Should your given solution be correct you will be able to press the proceed button to move to the next lesson.

This concludes our first tutorial lesson, in the next lesson you will learn about completing challenges. You may simply press the proceed button.
